# Discord-Bot
Bot I wrote to teach myself Python and the Discord API

It's rather simple and with some small modifications can be used as a discord bot for any server. 
It has some small games, and can detect when a member joins and leaves a certain server. 
The bot can also detect when it has been mentioned and respond to that mention, and it will react to any user that posts and image on the server. 


You are welcome to use this code for anything you like :)
